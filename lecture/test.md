The condition:

```cpp
(x >= 0 && x < N && y >= 0 && y < N && maze[x][y] == 1 && visited[x][y] == 0)
```

is used to **validate a move** in a 2D grid-based problem like the maze-solving example. Let's break it down step by step:

---

### **Purpose**
This checks whether a cell `(x, y)` is a **valid position** to move into during the backtracking process. If the condition is true, the move is allowed. Otherwise, it is rejected.

---

### **Components of the Condition**

#### 1. **`x >= 0 && x < N`**
   - Ensures that the **row index `x`** is within bounds:
     - `x >= 0`: The row index is not negative (stays within the top boundary of the grid).
     - `x < N`: The row index is less than `N` (stays within the bottom boundary of the grid).
   - Together, these ensure that the move does not go outside the grid vertically.

#### 2. **`y >= 0 && y < N`**
   - Ensures that the **column index `y`** is within bounds:
     - `y >= 0`: The column index is not negative (stays within the left boundary of the grid).
     - `y < N`: The column index is less than `N` (stays within the right boundary of the grid).
   - Together, these ensure that the move does not go outside the grid horizontally.

#### 3. **`maze[x][y] == 1`**
   - Checks whether the cell `(x, y)` is a **valid path** in the maze:
     - If `maze[x][y] == 1`, the cell is open and can be moved into.
     - If `maze[x][y] == 0`, the cell is a wall or obstacle, and the move is blocked.

#### 4. **`visited[x][y] == 0`**
   - Ensures that the cell `(x, y)` has **not been visited** yet:
     - `visited[x][y] == 0`: The cell has not been visited, so we can explore it.
     - `visited[x][y] == 1`: The cell has already been visited, so revisiting it would create unnecessary loops.

---

### **Combining Everything**
The condition ensures that:
1. `(x, y)` is **within the grid boundaries**.
2. `(x, y)` is **an open path** in the maze (`1` in the grid).
3. `(x, y)` has **not been visited** yet, avoiding redundant exploration or infinite loops.

If all these are satisfied, the cell `(x, y)` is a valid position to move to.

---

### **Real-Life Example**
Consider the following grid (maze):
```
1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 1 1 1
```
- `N = 4` (size of the grid).
- Assume `visited` starts as all `0`s.

Letâ€™s evaluate a move to `(2, 1)`:
- `x = 2, y = 1`.
- `x >= 0` and `x < N`: True (row index is within bounds).
- `y >= 0` and `y < N`: True (column index is within bounds).
- `maze[x][y] == 1`: True (`maze[2][1] = 1` is a valid path).
- `visited[x][y] == 0`: True (`visited[2][1] = 0`, not yet visited).

The cell `(2, 1)` is valid.

---

Now consider `(2, 2)`:
- `x = 2, y = 2`.
- `x >= 0` and `x < N`: True.
- `y >= 0` and `y < N`: True.
- `maze[x][y] == 1`: False (`maze[2][2] = 0`, a wall).
- `visited[x][y] == 0`: Irrelevant (already invalid due to `maze[x][y] == 0`).

The cell `(2, 2)` is invalid.

---

This logical check ensures safe and correct exploration of paths in the grid.
