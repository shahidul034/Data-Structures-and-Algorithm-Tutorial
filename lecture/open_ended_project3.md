I'll suggest an appropriate beginner-level project that incorporates multiple concepts from your syllabus while remaining achievable within a week. Here's my suggestion:

**Project Title: Library Management System with Analytics Dashboard**

**Project Description:**
Students will create a simple library management system that uses various data structures to manage books, borrowers, and generate basic analytics. This project is suitable for beginners as it can be implemented with basic functionality first and enhanced based on student capabilities.

**Core Requirements:**

1. Book Management:
   - Use classes/structures to represent books (title, author, ISBN, status)
   - Implement an array or vector (STL) to store books
   - Use linked lists to maintain borrowing history

2. Borrower Management:
   - Queue implementation for book reservations
   - Stack to maintain recent transactions

3. Search and Sort:
   - Implement at least two sorting algorithms to sort books by different criteria
   - Binary tree for efficient book searching

4. Analytics Features:
   - Simple graph representation to show book categories and their connections
   - Basic backtracking to find all possible book recommendations based on genre

**Marking Criteria (20 marks):**

1. Data Structure Implementation (8 marks)
   - Correct implementation of Linked List (2 marks)
   - Queue and Stack operations (2 marks)
   - Binary Tree implementation (2 marks)
   - Graph representation (2 marks)

2. Core Functionality (6 marks)
   - Book addition/removal (1 mark)
   - Borrower management (1 mark)
   - Search functionality (2 marks)
   - Sorting implementation (2 marks)

3. Code Quality (4 marks)
   - Proper use of classes and structures (1 mark)
   - STL usage (1 mark)
   - Code organization and comments (1 mark)
   - Error handling (1 mark)

4. Documentation (2 marks)
   - README file with setup instructions (1 mark)
   - Sample input/output examples (1 mark)

**Optional Features** (students can implement for bonus learning):
- Implement simple book recommendations using backtracking
- Add basic file handling for persistent storage
- Create a simple command-line interface

**Why this project is suitable for beginners:**
1. Clear modular structure allowing step-by-step implementation
2. Covers all major topics from the syllabus
3. Can be completed with basic functionality in a week
4. Scalable - students can add features based on their understanding
5. Real-world application that students can relate to

**Implementation Tips for Students:**
1. Start with basic book and borrower classes
2. Implement core data structures one at a time
3. Begin with array-based storage before moving to more complex structures
4. Test each component separately
5. Add features incrementally
