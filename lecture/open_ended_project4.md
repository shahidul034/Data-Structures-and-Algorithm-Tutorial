### **Open-Ended Project Suggestion**

#### **Project Title: "Library Book Management System"**

**Objective:**  
Develop a basic Library Book Management System that utilizes data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees to manage library operations such as book cataloging, searching, issuing, and returning.

---

#### **Project Scope:**  
Students will implement the following features:

1. **Book Cataloging**:  
   - Store book details (Title, Author, ISBN, etc.) using arrays or STL vectors.  
   - Allow adding, deleting, and viewing books.

2. **Book Search**:  
   - Use sorting and searching algorithms to find books by Title or ISBN.

3. **Book Issuing and Returning**:  
   - Implement a stack for "recently returned books."  
   - Use a queue to manage requests for a specific book.

4. **Member Management**:  
   - Use a linked list to store and manage member information (Name, ID, etc.).  
   - Link issued books to members.

5. **Library Section Hierarchy**:  
   - Represent the library's hierarchy (e.g., Fiction, Non-Fiction, Science) using a tree structure.

6. **Graph-Based Features (Optional for Extra Credit)**:  
   - Represent relationships between library sections (e.g., related categories) using a graph.

### **Guidelines for Students**

- **Divide the Work**: Break down the project into smaller tasks and plan the implementation.  
- **Use STL Where Appropriate**: Leverage STL for easier implementation of queues, stacks, and linked lists.  
- **Keep it Simple**: Focus on functionality rather than complex features.  
- **Submit on Time**: Prepare a small report with code, screenshots, and a brief explanation of the structures used.
