### Open-Ended Project: **"Pathfinding and Optimization in a Maze"**

---

#### **Project Description:**
Students will design and implement a program to solve a maze using **data structures and algorithms**. The maze will be represented as a graph, and students can utilize **stacks**, **queues**, **linked lists**, and **backtracking** to find the optimal path from the start point to the endpoint. They can also implement sorting algorithms or use STL to handle or visualize different aspects of the problem.

---

#### **Mandatory Components (Topics to Cover):**
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent the maze using an adjacency list or adjacency matrix (e.g., using STL containers).
   - Allow the maze to have weighted paths (optional for additional credit).

2. **Pathfinding Algorithm:**
   - Implement algorithms like **DFS** or **BFS** using stacks and queues.
   - Optionally compare with advanced algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s or A* for better optimization.

3. **Backtracking:**
   - Implement backtracking to find all possible paths and then determine the shortest one.

4. **Dynamic Data Structures:**
   - Use **linked lists** to store paths or node traversal history dynamically.

5. **Sorting (Optional for Extra Features):**
   - Sort paths by length or other criteria if multiple solutions exist.

6. **Tree Representation (Optional for Visualization):**
   - Convert the maze or paths into a tree structure for easier analysis and visualization.

---

#### **Expected Outcomes:**
- Functional program that solves the maze and finds at least one valid path.
- Students demonstrate understanding of the chosen data structures and algorithms.
- Analysis of time and space complexity of the implemented solution.
